iOS app written in swift to help people generatenew secure pass-phrases.

#wtf
Basically just a quick app I hacked together to learn about Swift, happened to have seen an article about password length vs strength and thought this would be a quick and simple hack to implement.

#ToDo
Add pronouns into phrases at some point to help brain remember.
Mix in famous quotes with the odd word changed for something funner..
e.g. "Here's looking at you, Adult" or "Andy you're a wizard!!"

Add in password strength indicator.
Add in info panel to explain wtf is going on.
